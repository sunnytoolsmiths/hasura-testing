# Location of the Project's Subgraphs.
# Subgraphs are used to group your metadata objects together in a way 
# that makes sense for your application and your team. Multiple HML files can belong to a 
# Subgraph and you can have multiple Subgraphs in your Supergraph. We have created 
# the Subgraph "app" by default to get you started.
subgraphs:
  app:
    path: ./app
  
# The default SupergraphManifest to create a SupergraphBuild with
# when no SupergraphManifest is explicitly specified.
